When using the conv_der function, we used a basic kernel in order to derive the image on each direction, which translates
virtually to subtract every two pixels that have one pixel between them.
fourier_der on the other hand, uses other method in order to derive the image on each direction - It takes each frequency
component and multiplies it with the index representing it. This results in enhanced frequency components in correlation
with the frequency magnitude (index). In conclusion, we see that fourier_der gives us more enhanced derived image,
including noisy frequencies, while conv_der gives us less noisy image.
