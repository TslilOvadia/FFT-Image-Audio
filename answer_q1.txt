change_rate function makes the audio run faster than the original audio, and we can hear all the frequencies
and all the components that made the sound, just that in this case it is all sound high pitched when compared to the
original audio.
change_samples on the other hand, when we can hear only part of the frequencies components we heared on the original
audio. The reason for this is that we manipulated the original audio in a manner that "spreads" the frequencies in
accordance to the ratio, which translates to basically "cutt off" the high frequency components. this results in
a faster sound but we can hear only part of the frequencies components.
