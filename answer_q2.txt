When using the resize_spectrogram we get that we hear the sound of the audio clearly only partially - there are times
when the sound is clearly played, and there are times when the sound is fading out and not so clear.
When we manipulated the frequencies inside the spetrogram but not paying attention to the imact it has on the phase,
we're causing to a phenomena called destructive interference - where two (or more) waves with an opposite phase meet,
their amplitudes will be subtracted from one another, which will lead to the pattern described above.
this is why the resize_vocoder function output sounded better.
